Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Writing Content for Your Portfolio

Most of the content can be found under `/content`.
- `/content/skills.ts` is a list of tech/skills that you use with their corresponding icons from Iconfiy.
- `/content/experiences.ts` is a list of your work history in a resume/CV format.
- `/content/posts.ts` is a list of blog posts.
- `/content/projects.tsx` is a list of projects you've worked in, the tech you used, and some images to showcase your work.
- `/content/services.ts` is a list of services you offer to clients.

Make sure to also modify `/components/SiteLayout.tsx` for SEO.

For project and blog images, stick with a 4x3 ratio.
