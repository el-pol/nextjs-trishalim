          I'm a Full Stack Engineer specializing in React + Next.js + TypeScript with
          5 years experience building single page applications.
          I'm dedicated to delivering great user experiences, writing clean code,
          and working closely with designers.

          I've worked on large B2B apps and content-managed websites for various clients in the US,
          New Zealand and Australia. I've mostly done this remotely, working with teams across
          different timezones.
