          Hey, I'm Trisha! üëã
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Engineer specializing in React + Next.js + TypeScript with
          5 years experience building single page applications.
          I'm dedicated to delivering great user experiences, writing clean code,
          and working closely with designers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've worked on large B2B apps and content-managed websites for various clients in the US,
          New Zealand and Australia. I've mostly done this remotely, working with teams across
          different timezones.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently living the island life at Koh Samui üèù, Thailand.
