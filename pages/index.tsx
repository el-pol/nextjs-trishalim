          Hey, I&apos;m Trisha! üëã
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;m a Full-Stack Engineer specializing in React + Next.js + TypeScript with
          5 years experience building single page applications.
          I&apos;m dedicated to delivering great user experiences by working closely with
          designers, and writing good quality code to maintain a good developer experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve worked on large B2B apps and content-managed websites for clients in the US,
          New Zealand and Australia. I'm a seasoned remote worker capable of working across timezones
          with teams of diverse backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;m currently living the island life at Koh Samui üèù, Thailand.
